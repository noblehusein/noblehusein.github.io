I'm a Robotics Engineer with a Master's degree in Robotics and Control from Columbia University. Currently based in California, I've spent the last two years working with innovative robotics startups, developing cutting-edge solutions in the field of automation and robotics.

In my current role at GrayMatter Robotics, I've worked accross the software stack. From software architecture to fundemental robotics problems in 2D/3D vision, path and trajectory planning, and AI research and integration.

On the side I love reading up and learning about the latest advancements in robotics and AI. and working on personal projects about the same.
