### GrayMatter Robotics
**Role:** Robotics Software Engineer  
**Location:** Los Angeles, California  
**Duration:** January 2023 - Present  

#### Vision Systems & AI Development
- Created custom denoising filters for 3D point cloud data allowing for smoother path and trajectory planning.
- Set up of inspection robot: involving creating a custom C++ ROS node that integrated inhouse software nodes of path & trajectory planers with software nodes of external partners @University of Washington, in a dual robot setup, handling image capture and classification.
- Developed and deployed a CNN-based detection system for sandpaper monitoring with 100k+ images, implementing transfer learning techniques to achieve robust performance across different deployment sites
- Researched into advanced classification methods including Vision Transformers, VLMs and multi-input models for enhancing accuracy.

#### Software Architecture & System Integration
- Redesigned ROS architecture for automated sandpaper replacement system, enabling modular integration of multiple sandpaper types and detection models
- Architected a comprehensive data recording system for multi-node ROS environments, enabling real-time monitoring via Formant Platform integration
- Led refactoring initiatives for segmentation nodes to improve scalability and usability for application engineers
- Contributed to US Patent No. 11,820,017-B1 for innovative methods in robotic tool tracking and replacement

#### Motion Planning & Optimization
- Enhanced collision detection systems using NVIDIA PhysX and Isaac Sim, implementing geometric primitive setup and GJK query pipeline
- Optimized performance through multi-threaded collision checking across planner nodes
- Improved trajectory generation algorithms to reduce cycle time between multiple passes

#### Miscellaneous Projects
- Led development of special projects including an innovative robotic pumpkin carving, Christmas tree decorating.
