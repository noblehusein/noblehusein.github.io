## Project Overview
In this project, we developed a quadruped robot from concept to completion, incorporating advanced features like human movement mimicry and stability control. The project demonstrates end-to-end robotics development, including mechanical design, manufacturing, and software integration.

## Key Features
- Custom-designed and 3D-printed chassis and components
- Implemented walking and dancing gaits
- IMU-based stabilization system
- Raspberry Pi camera integration for visual inputs

## Development Process
### Design & Manufacturing
- Created detailed CAD models for all components
- Optimized designs for 3D printing
- Assembled custom components and electronics

### Software Development
- Developed gait control algorithms
- Implemented dance movement patterns
- Created computer vision system for movement recognition
- Integrated IMU data for balance control
