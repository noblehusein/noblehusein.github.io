## Project Overview
Developed an automated system for decorating Christmas trees using industrial robotics. The project combined 3D scanning, geometric path planning, and precise robot control to wrap garlands around a tree in a helical pattern.

## Technical Implementation
- Designed custom roller fixture to rotate the tree
- Created 3D scanning setup to capture tree geometry.
- estimated the tree's conical shape and generated motion path and robot trajectory.
- scavenged makeshift end effector from a 3D printer to hold the garland
