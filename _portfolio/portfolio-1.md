## Project Overview
Using a FANUC m710 industrial robot, we developed an automated system to carve Halloween pumpkins. The project combined 3D scanning, point cloud processing, and precise robot control to create an automated pumpkin carving solution.

## Implementation Details
- Secured pumpkin using a custom-designed spoke holder for stability
- Performed 3D scanning of the pumpkin surface
- Processed scan data to isolate dark regions corresponding to eyes and mouth patterns
- Generated optimized tool paths for the carved features
- Conducted TCP (Tool Center Point) calibration for precise control
- Experimented with various RPM settings to determine optimal milling depth
